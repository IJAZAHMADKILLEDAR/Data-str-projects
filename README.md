Transform Data Structures into Interactive Learning Experiences 🚀

## Overview

Welcome! This project is all about making data structures less intimidating and a lot more fun to learn. With Java and a simple GUI, you can visualize, manage, and play around with arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. No more staring at code and wondering what’s going on—see it in action!

## Communication Style

- **My Preferred Tone:** Relaxed and easygoing, but not overly friendly.
    - Use natural, simple language.
    - Keep the mentee comfortable without pressure.
    - Use some emojis and light humor (but not as much as Friendly tone).
    - Avoid hardcore slangs or strict/formal language.
- **My Preferred Language:** Communicate entirely in English.
